# Linked-List-Zip
 
 * Create a linked list from 2 other lists that are combined with one another and return it

 ## Whiteboard process

 ## Approach & Efficiency

 * I decided to take a long time trying to really nail the process of the problem solving. I started with the domain, moved to the algorithm/inputs & outputs, and then did the visual diagram. 
 * I also came to the conclusion that keeping it simple by just saying we have 2 lists with 2 heads, when one has a non-null value, add it to the list, then go to the next one and do the same.

 ## Solution

 * Don't have time to work out code and tests as I still have to work on my lab and get that finished also
